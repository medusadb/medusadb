# MedusaDB

MedusaDB is a new kind of decentralised database that can scale to millions of entries of any size. MedusaDB is designed to optimize storage space and reads. As past data in MedusaDB is immutable, it is perfect for source-control and systems that require unalterable audit trails.

More to come soon!
