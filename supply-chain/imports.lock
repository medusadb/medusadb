A comment in get_sni_extension asks whether the behaviour of parsing an IPv4 or IPv6 address
in a host_name field of a server_name extension, but then ignoring the extension (because
'Literal IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are not permitted in \"HostName\"'), as the server, is
compliant with RFC 6066. As an original author of RFC 3546 which has very similar wording,
I can speak to the intent: yes this is fine. The client is clearly nonconformant in this
case, but the server isn't.

RFC 3546 said \"If the server understood the client hello extension but does not recognize
the server name, it SHOULD send an \"unrecognized_name\" alert (which MAY be fatal).\"
This wording was preserved in RFC 5746, and then updated in RFC 6066 to:

   If the server understood the ClientHello extension but
   does not recognize the server name, the server SHOULD take one of two
   actions: either abort the handshake by sending a fatal-level
   unrecognized_name(112) alert or continue the handshake.  It is NOT
   RECOMMENDED to send a warning-level unrecognized_name(112) alert,
   because the client's behavior in response to warning-level alerts is
   unpredictable.  If there is a mismatch between the server name used
   by the client application and the server name of the credential
   chosen by the server, this mismatch will become apparent when the
   client application performs the server endpoint identification, at
   which point the client application will have to decide whether to
   proceed with the communication.

To me it's clear that it is reasonable to consider an IP address as a name that the
server does not recognize. And so the server SHOULD *either* send a fatal unrecognized_name
alert, *or* continue the handshake and let the client application decide when it \"performs
the server endpoint identification\". There's no conformance requirement for the server to
take any notice of a host_name that is \"not permitted\". (It would have been clearer to
express this by specifying the allowed client and server behaviour separately, i.e. saying
that the client MUST NOT send an IP address in host_name, and then explicitly specifying
the server behaviour if it does so anyway. That's how I would write it now. But honestly
this extension was one of the most bikeshedded parts of RFC 3546, to a much greater extent
than I'd anticipated, and I was tired.)
